# Navneeth Subramanian

Computer vision expert with 20+ years of leadership in AI and software engineering. Currently a Group Manager at Bosch Japan developing ADAS perception systems for automotive applications.

Previously served as Principal Engineer & Manager at Canon developing deep learning algorithms for imaging products.

Imaging Scientist at GE Research creating medical imaging solutions.

Notable achievements include:
- AI-powered autofocus systems for professional cameras
- Semi-Conductor process yield improvements using AI 
- Real-time biometrics on cardiac structures in ultrasound images
- GPU-accelerated volume rendering for surgical applications

Author of 20 peer-reviewed publications and inventor on 10+ US patents. M.S. from SUNY Buffalo with expertise in PyTorch, TensorFlow, C++, and Python.

Specializes in optimizing neural networks for deployment on resource-constrained hardware while maintaining high performance.

### Topics that interest me

Methods to generate and use synthetic data in training neural nets.  

Loss functions and the peculiar ways in which neural networks learn to cheat in reaching a loss objective.  

In the past I worked on volume rendering. I find recent advances on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) fascinating.
