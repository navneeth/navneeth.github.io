Topics that interest me: 
Methods to generate and use syntetic data in training neural nets. 
Loss functions and the peculiar ways in which neural networks learn to cheat in reaching a loss objective.
In the past I worked on volume rendering. I find recent advances on Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) fascinating.

### More Information
